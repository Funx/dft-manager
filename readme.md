# Cycle-Starter
This is a sample project to get started with Cycle.js

### Getting up and running
- Install dependencies
```
  npm install
```
- Run webpack-dev-server
```
  npm start
```
- Build and run Isomorphic/production server
```
  npm run server
```

W.I.P. This is nowhere near a complete state.
